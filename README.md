# 💻 **Laptop Price Prediction**

A machine learning project to predict the selling price of a laptop based on its specifications.  
Users can input features like RAM, GPU, CPU, brand, etc. and get a price estimate.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This repository contains the full pipeline for predicting laptop prices:
- Data preprocessing, cleaning & feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation (regression)  
- Deployment via a web interface (Streamlit / Flask / other)  

The goal is to convert laptop specs into a predicted price using a trained model.

## 🧠 **Artifacts & Files**

Typical files included in this repo:

- `model.pkl` or `pipe.pkl` — trained regression model / pipeline  
- `scaler.pkl` — (if separate) scaler for numerical features  
- `laptop_price_app.py` — the web app script (e.g. Streamlit or Flask)  
- `notebook.ipynb` — exploratory data analysis, modeling  
- `laptop_data.csv` — dataset with features and prices  
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies  
- `README.md` — this file

## 💻 **Tech Stack**

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Streamlit or Flask (or your chosen web framework)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 **Usage (What Inputs Are Required)**

The web app will ask for laptop specifications such as:

- Brand / Company

- Type (Ultrabook, Gaming, etc.)

- RAM

- Storage type & capacity (SSD, HDD)

- GPU

- CPU

- Display size / resolution

- Weight

- Operating System

… and other relevant features

Entering those features returns a predicted price.

## 📈 **Model Performance**

R² score: 0.85

## 📊 **Use Cases**

E-commerce sites to suggest reasonable laptop prices

Helping customers estimate laptop value before buying or selling

Benchmarking different laptop configurations

Educational tool to showcase regression modeling
